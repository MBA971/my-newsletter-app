# Obsolete Files

This folder contains files that are no longer needed in the main project but are kept for reference or historical purposes.

## Contents:
- Debug scripts
- Test utilities
- Database export files
- Patch files
- Development utilities

These files were moved here to clean up the main project directory while preserving them in case they are needed for future reference.
